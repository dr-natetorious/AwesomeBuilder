# Awesome Builder

Awesome Builder is new employee training program that validates skills:

1. [Position Cloud Services and AWS](AWSomeBuilderDeck.pptx)
2. [Collect and Present Requirements](AWSomeBuilder-2_Alexa.pptx)
3. [Present a Functional Demo](AWSomeBuilder3.pptx)

Additionally, [SA Launch](SA-Launch-PresentedEdition.ppt), confirms that a virtual team can identify a business challenge, that is solveable with AWS services.  Our group built a service for detecting missing safety equipment (e.g., goggles and masks).
